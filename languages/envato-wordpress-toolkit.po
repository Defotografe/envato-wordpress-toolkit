"The Envato WordPress Toolkit is not hosted in the WordPress.org plugin "

"the ability for the plugin to update itself via our %s Github repository a "
"while back. However, it's possible that the %s class is slowing down your "
"admin page loads. This option will let you deactivate the updater so the "
"class does not loads and admin speeds will go back to normal. If you want to "
"update the plugin in the future, just uncheck this option and the plugin "
"will look for a new version on Github; check it and it stops looking."
